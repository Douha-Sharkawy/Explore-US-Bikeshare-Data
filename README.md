# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
## In this project, I used a data provided by a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States such as Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC, to uncover bike share usage patterns.
## Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

1. Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
2. End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
3. Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
4. Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
5. End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
6. User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

## The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns: Gender & Birth Year
## For computing a variety of descriptive statistics,  I wrote codes in python language to provide the following information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip
most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration
total travel time
average travel time

#4 User info
counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
